Firefox addon for That Startpage Rocks - Bookmark Launcher
=====

An addon for firefox that lets you access your bookmarks from your startpage at [That Startpage Rocks](http://that.startpage.rocks).

Install
------
Install it [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/that-startpage-rocks/), though you first need to create a startpage at http://that.startpage.rocks.      

Or, install [jpm]() and run, at the project's root folder:

>jpm xpi

This will create an `*.xpi` file. Open it with firefox and the browser will install it. A "+" icon will appear on firefox's toolbar, click on it and enjoy !
